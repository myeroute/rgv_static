Welcome to Retro Gaming Verse.
I’m Steven.

Retro Gaming Verse is a place where I write about my time playing games, in a very ordinary way.

I do not play games fast. I get lost easily. There are moments when I die over and over again without really understanding why. Sometimes I close the game simply because I feel tired, then come back the next day and somehow get past the part that stopped me before.

Those experiences are the reason Retro Gaming Verse exists.

When I use the word “retro,” I am not talking about a specific era or how old a game is. I am talking about a type of play experience. These are games that can still be played today as complete experiences, without constant updates, seasonal content, or pressure to keep up with anything outside the game itself.

Classic games are part of retro, but retro is not limited to classics.

I write about what I go through while playing, especially the moments when I feel confused, hesitant, or unsure about what to do next. Sometimes the problem is not difficulty, but the quiet feeling that you are doing something wrong, even when you are not.

Not every game here is old, and not every game is difficult. What matters is whether the game allows space for friction, mistakes, and reflection when played slowly.

Retro Gaming Verse does not try to cover everything about a game. Each post is just a small piece of the journey, written at the moment when I feel the need to slow down and think.

If you are playing a game and feel slightly out of sync, a bit lost, or simply wonder whether someone else has felt the same way, you might find something familiar here.
