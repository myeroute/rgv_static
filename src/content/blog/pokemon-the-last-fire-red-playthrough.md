<h2>About this playthrough</h2>
This playthrough was written in parallel with my actual gameplay, not after completing the game. I did not read walkthroughs in advance, did not optimize my route from the start, and did not know beforehand what changes <em>Pokémon The Last Fire Red</em> would introduce compared to the original Fire Red.

Everything recorded here reflects exactly what I encountered at that moment: the decisions I made, the things I misunderstood, the unexpected losses, and how I managed to move forward. If some parts are not optimal or differ from how others might play, that is intentional. The purpose of this article is not to show the “correct” way to play, but to document a real play experience.

This playthrough is meant to help players who are currently playing the game:
<ul>
 	<li>quickly check what exists in each area</li>
 	<li>and, when needed, read more deeply to understand where I struggled and how I got through it</li>
</ul>
This article also does not aim to be a perfect Pokemon the Last Fire Red walkthrough.
<h2>Pallet Town → Pewter City</h2>
The opening stretch feels very familiar at first, but subtle changes quickly hint that this will not be a relaxed Fire Red-style journey.

<h3>Pallet Town</h3>
Everything looks familiar here, which makes the small differences feel more noticeable than I expected.

The game starts in the main character’s room, which feels very familiar if you have played Fire Red before. When going downstairs, the game lets me choose the difficulty and optional modes such as hard mode or randomizer. I do not want to make things harder right away, so I choose Exit and play normally.

<details><summary><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read more</span></summary>Downstairs, my mom stops me to talk and gives me the Shiny Charm. At this point, I only know that it is related to shiny Pokémon, but I do not understand how it works yet, and I do not have any Pokémon to test it with.

She tells me to go to Professor Oak’s lab. When I arrive, only Green is there. Oak has not appeared yet. Out of habit from previous Pokémon games, I instinctively try to leave the town to see what would happen.

At the exit, I run into Serena from Vaniville Town in the Kalos region. She briefly introduces herself, says we will meet again in Viridian City, and then leaves. After walking a bit further, Professor Oak appears and calls me back to the lab.

Inside the lab, I choose my starter Pokémon. The options are Grookey, Sobble, and Scorbunny. I choose Scorbunny mainly for personal reasons. I do not like Sobble’s final evolution, and Grookey feels slower despite its physical strength. I want better speed for the early game.

Green chooses Sobble and immediately challenges me to a battle. I lose, but the game lets me continue, so I do not think too much about it. Around this time, I also notice that auto-run is available from the start using the L button on my emulator, unlike Fire Red where running is locked behind the first gym.

After getting my first Pokémon, I try to give the Shiny Charm to Scorbunny, but the game says it cannot be held. After checking further, I realize that the item only needs to be registered.

<h3>Route 1</h3>
At first, Route 1 feels like a routine transition, which makes the sudden interruption here much more jarring than expected.

At this point, I still do not have any Poké Balls, so Route 1 feels like nothing more than the connecting path to Viridian City, exactly like in the original Fire Red. I barely think about it and run straight ahead, planning to go to the PokéMart, get Oak’s Parcel, and then come back.

However, unlike Fire Red, the game stops me here with a forced battle against Ritchie. His Pikachu has the ability Static, while my Scorbunny at this stage does not have many options besides basic physical attacks.

<details><summary><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read more</span></summary>I fight on instinct, relying on physical moves. It only takes one Static activation for Scorbunny to become paralyzed for the entire battle. In that state, I can barely do anything meaningful and end up losing very quickly.

After that, I go back and train Scorbunny to around level 9. By then, it learns Ember. When I challenge Ritchie again, I deliberately use a special move instead of physical attacks. Pikachu still has Static, but the battle becomes much easier to control, and I manage to win.

Route 1 no longer feels like a filler path. The game deliberately blocks the player early on and forces an adjustment to a different rhythm.

</details></details></div>

<h3>Viridian City</h3>
Viridian City feels familiar at a glance, but it quickly turns into a place where progress keeps getting interrupted rather than moving forward smoothly.

Upon arriving in Viridian City, I notice a large white, dome-like structure that I cannot enter at this point, so I simply ignore it and move on.

My immediate goal here is straightforward: enter the PokéMart, receive Oak’s Parcel, and then return to Pallet Town to deliver it to Professor Oak. After doing so, Oak gives me Poké Balls and the Pokédex.

<details><summary><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read more</span></summary>Green suggests that I visit his house to receive the Town Map from his sister. After getting the Town Map, I return to Viridian City to continue.

Inside the Pokémon Center, I meet Serena again, but the entrance is blocked by a Magma Grunt and an Aqua Grunt. I team up with Serena to battle them. Their Pokémon are Poochyena Lv4 and Ekans Lv4, and the fight mainly serves as an introduction rather than a real challenge.

After winning, Serena gives me the Z-Ring, which allows the use of Z-Moves in battle, and then leaves. This is the first time the game formally introduces the Z-Move mechanic, but at this stage I cannot really make use of it yet.

The Pokémon Center also sells Ability Capsules for $10,000. I take note of this but do not seriously consider it, since my team is still unstable and I have no intention of adjusting abilities this early.

</details></details></div>

<h3>Route 22</h3>
Route 22 feels optional at first, but it quietly becomes a place where I regain control after the early setbacks.
<div class="rgv-route-accordion">

<!-- WILD POKEMON -->

Route 22 is a path I take mostly out of habit from the old Fire Red. Whenever I see a side route, I tend to explore it without really thinking about optimization or preparation for future battles.

There is a Berry tree here that appears to refresh frequently. It is not a one-time interaction. Every time I pass through Route 22, I instinctively check whether it has produced another Berry. It is a small detail, but it makes the area feel worth revisiting rather than a one-and-done path.

<details><summary><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read more</span></summary>Among the wild Pokémon here, I decide to catch Morpeko. The reason is simple: Green is using Sobble, and after the frustrating experience on Route 1, I want better type coverage to deal with his team.

At the end of the route, there is a Pokémon Den. I try to interact with it, but nothing happens. I only register that a Den exists here. At this point, I have no idea what condition is required to activate it, only that it is not usable yet.

Green stops me again for a battle on Route 22. He uses Rookidee and Sobble. Thanks to Morpeko, this fight feels much easier than our encounter on Route 1. There is no longer a sense of being caught off guard. It feels more like a proper rival battle between two developing teams.

After finishing Route 22, I return to the main path with a slightly more stable team. There is no major event here, but skipping this route would clearly make the next sections much harder to manage.

</details></details></div>

<hr />

<h3>Route 2</h3>
Route 2 looks familiar and calm on the surface, but it quietly starts reshaping how I approach training and encounters.
<div class="rgv-route-accordion">

<details><summary>What happened</summary>After Route 22, I return to the main path and head up Route 2, feeling a bit more comfortable now that my team includes Morpeko. The route looks very familiar if you have played Fire Red, so at first I do not expect anything too different.

Among the wild Pokémon, I briefly consider catching Fletchling, since its final evolution, Talonflame, is known for its speed. However, because it overlaps with my Fire-type starter, I decide not to catch it for now and simply remember Route 2 as a place I could return to later.

<details open="open"><summary><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read more</span></summary>I pick up an Ability Capsule here. When I collect it, the game displays its description, and only then do I fully understand that it is an item used to change abilities. I do not plan to use it immediately, but its early appearance makes me pay more attention to abilities, rather than focusing only on levels or types like in older games.

Continuing forward, I run into Ash for a battle. His team is not too difficult, but the fight lasts long enough to feel meaningful. After winning, Ash gives me the Exp. Share. I turn it on right away, understanding it as a way for Pokémon to gain experience even without entering battle.

While training on Route 2, I realize for the first time that the game includes double battles with wild Pokémon. This is not explained beforehand. I only discover it when the battle starts, which immediately changes how cautious I am during random encounters.

<img class="size-medium" src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/0126/12/p1/battle%20with%202%20wild%20pokemons.webp" alt="Double battle with wild Pokémon on Route 2" width="637" height="319" />

Route 2 does not have any major events or particularly frustrating battles, but it is where I start to notice that The Last Fire Red is quietly changing the familiar gameplay rhythm through small, easily missed details.

After finishing Route 2, I head into Viridian Forest with the sense that the game is slowly tightening its difficulty, rather than letting the player move forward comfortably like in the original Fire Red.

</details></details></div>

<h3>Viridian Forest</h3>
Viridian Forest feels much longer and more draining than I remember, turning what used to be a short transition into a real endurance test.

<img class="size-medium" src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/0126/12/p1/aqua%20grunt%20and%20magma%20grunt%20in%20viridian%20forest.webp" alt="Magma Grunt and Aqua Grunt encounter in Viridian Forest with Brendan" width="637" height="319" />

Viridian Forest is a large area filled with trainers and tall grass. While not every battle is difficult on its own, fighting repeatedly and training in the grass drains my team much faster than I expect. I end up accepting a slower pace, going partway through the forest, returning to the Pokémon Center to heal, and then coming back, instead of pushing through in one run like in older games.

<details><summary><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read more</span></summary>While exploring the forest, I pick up Normalium Z. I give it to Pikachu to see how Z-Moves work. This is my first time using a Z-Move in a more serious situation, and I treat it mainly as a way to understand the mechanic rather than relying on it heavily.

Going deeper, I run into the Magma Grunt and Aqua Grunt again, this time with Brendan helping me. The battle itself is not too intense, but it makes it clear that the game is starting to connect different character threads, instead of keeping encounters isolated like in the very early sections.

After the battle, Brendan gives me the Dynamax Band. At this point, I know that both Z-Moves and Dynamax are now available, but since the game does not force me to use Dynamax right away, I simply take note of it and move on.

Near the end of the forest, I pick up a Wish Piece, but the game warns that it should only be used after obtaining the Boulder Badge. Because of that warning, I decide not to experiment with it yet.

Leaving Viridian Forest, I pass through a rest stop where Chansey heals my Pokémon. After a long stretch without reliable recovery points, this moment feels like a clear transition before entering Pewter City.

</details></details></div>

<h3>Pewter City</h3>
Pewter City looks familiar, but it quickly becomes a place where the game starts demanding real adjustments rather than letting me move forward on habit alone.

<img class="size-medium" src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/0126/12/p1/meeting%20Saad%20in%20Pewter%20city.webp" alt="Meeting Saad in Pewter City" width="637" height="319" />

After passing the rest stop following Viridian Forest, I check the nearby grass to see if anything differs from Route 2 earlier. Here, I encounter rarer Pokémon such as Clefairy, Chewtle, and Abra. They do not appear throughout the entire route, but are limited to this specific area, so I make a mental note to return if needed.

Inside Pewter City, I meet May and am immediately pulled into a battle. Her team is not too difficult, but it serves as a check on my team after the long forest section. After winning, May gives me the DexNav. I do not use it right away, but I register that the game is adding more support tools.

<details open="open"><summary><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read more</span></summary>I stop by the Pokémon Center to heal and talk to NPCs. One NPC offers to change a Pokémon’s Nature for $50,000. I read the option and move on, since my team is not finalized and changing Nature this early feels excessive.

Outside the Pokémon Center, I meet Saad. One look at his team makes it clear that this is not a casual fight. Saad uses Jangmo-o Lv13, Gible Lv13, and Dratini Lv13. This battle is noticeably harder than others in the city, forcing me to catch and train Clefairy just to get through it.

After defeating Saad, I receive Dratini Lv15. This is a major reward at this point in the game, and the main reason I decide to come back and fight him instead of skipping the encounter. With Dratini in hand, I start thinking more seriously about my team beyond simply relying on my starter.

After finishing up in the city, I enter the Pewter City Gym. I clear the trainers inside to get a feel for it, but lose to Brock on my first attempt. This loss does not surprise me, as the first gym in this version is clearly more demanding than in the original Fire Red.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/0126/12/p1/brock%20the%20gym%20leader%20of%20pewter%20city.webp" alt="Brock, the Gym Leader of Pewter City - Pokemon the Last Fire Red" width="637" height="319" />

After adjusting my team and returning, I defeat Brock and receive the Boulder Badge along with TM39 Rock Tomb. I do not analyze this battle in detail here, since my experience losing to Brock and why this gym feels harder is covered in a separate article.

Near the gym, I find a Warp Hole. The game allows me to choose a shiny Pokémon here, and I catch a Froakie Lv12 with the Ability Protean. This is an unexpected moment at this stage and neatly closes out the Pewter City section.

After Pewter City, I leave with a team that looks very different from when I first arrived, ready to move on toward Route 3.

<details><summary>Team state (after Pewter City)</summary>Raboot, Pikachu, Clefairy, Lotad, Morpeko, Froakie, Dratini

</details></details></details></div>
<h2>Pewter City → Cerulean City</h2>
After the first gym, the journey stops feeling introductory and starts demanding consistency, with longer routes and fewer moments to reset.

<h3>Route 3</h3>
Route 3 is where the game shifts from short encounters to sustained pressure, quietly wearing the team down before Mt. Moon.

<details open="open"><summary>What happened</summary>After Pewter City, Route 3 feels longer than expected. The path itself is straightforward, but the density of trainers quickly turns it into a sequence of back-to-back battles rather than a place to explore.

Most of the individual fights are manageable, but they stack up. I find myself paying more attention to HP, status effects, and resource management instead of experimenting or catching new Pokémon.

Near the end of the route, Team Rocket blocks the way. The battle stands out less for complexity and more for pressure, reinforcing the sense that the game is steadily tightening its grip.

By the time I reach the Pokémon Center at the end of Route 3, it feels less like a checkpoint and more like a necessary pause before entering Mt. Moon.

</details></div>
<h3>Mt. Moon</h3>
Mt. Moon turns the journey into a sustained dungeon crawl, where progress depends more on endurance and resource management than on single battles.

<details open="open"><summary>What happened</summary>Entering Mt. Moon, the cave immediately feels larger and more demanding than anything before it. Progress is no longer about clearing a route, but about surviving a long stretch without reliable recovery.

<details open="open"><summary><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read more</span></summary>Encounters inside the cave are packed tightly together. Even when individual battles are manageable, they begin stacking up, slowly draining HP and resources.

At one point, I discover a side area with Chansey that can heal my team. This immediately changes how I approach Mt. Moon. Instead of forcing my way forward, I accept that moving back and forth is part of progressing through the cave.

As I go deeper, multiple factions appear at once. Team Rocket, along with Aqua and Magma grunts, turn Mt. Moon into a chaotic space rather than a simple hideout. The sheer number of encounters reinforces the feeling that this dungeon is designed to wear the player down over time.

<img class="size-medium" src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/0126/12/p2/mt-moon-rocket-encounter.webp" alt="Team Rocket encounter inside Mt. Moon in Pokémon The Last Fire Red" width="637" height="319" />

Eventually, I reach the fossil area and make a choice without overthinking it. At that moment, getting through the cave intact feels more important than the long-term outcome of the decision.

After choosing the fossil, I move forward assuming Mt. Moon is nearly finished, only to realize that a battle with Brendan is waiting ahead. Instead of pushing through unprepared, I go back to Chansey to fully recover before continuing.

Only after healing do I return to face Brendan. The battle works as a checkpoint rather than a surprise, testing whether my team can still hold together after everything Mt. Moon has already demanded.

By the time I exit the cave, Mt. Moon has done its job. I am not stuck, but I am clearly worn down, and stepping out into Route 4 feels like a brief release before reaching Cerulean City.

</details></details></div>
<h3>Route 4</h3>
After Mt. Moon, Route 4 feels like an open exhale, a brief stretch meant to let the player recover before reaching Cerulean City.

<details><summary>What happened</summary>Compared to Mt. Moon, Route 4 is calm and open. There is space to move, fewer interruptions, and enough breathing room to reset after the cave.

I do not spend much time here. The route feels less like a destination and more like a release valve, easing the transition from the pressure of Mt. Moon into the next city.

After crossing Route 4, Cerulean City comes into view almost immediately, marking a clear shift from survival back to preparation.

<h3>Cerulean City</h3>
Cerulean City initially looks like a safe checkpoint after Mt. Moon, but it quickly turns into one of the most event-heavy sections so far, chaining encounters without giving much room to settle.

<details open="open"><summary>What happened</summary>Right at the entrance of Cerulean City, I notice a Warp Hole and decide to check it. Inside, I find Azelf at level 20. After spending a long time trying and reloading with Great Balls, I eventually use the Master Ball. Getting such a powerful Pokémon this early immediately makes me cautious about what the game might throw next.

<details open="open"><summary><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read more</span></summary>Near the Pokémon Center, I run into Tracey, who challenges me to a battle. His team is not trivial, and after winning, he gives me the Amulet Coin.

After healing, I head north and unexpectedly run into Professor Oak, who immediately challenges me to a battle instead of simply giving an item. The fight itself is manageable, but the surprise factor reinforces the sense that Cerulean City is not meant to be a calm stop.

Exploring further, I enter a house where Psychic Jaden offers an Inverse Battle, flipping type effectiveness. The fight feels more like a mental exercise than a difficulty spike, and I receive several Sitrus Berries afterward.

Before heading to the gym, Green stops me for another rival battle. Compared to earlier encounters, this one feels more deliberate and structured, signaling that rival fights are becoming more serious.

Going into the Cerulean Gym, I am much more cautious than I was in Pewter City. Misty chooses to Dynamax Barraskewda, and that single decision defines the entire fight.

With its extremely high Attack and Speed, Barraskewda consistently moves first. In Dynamax form, the pressure becomes overwhelming, leaving very little room to react or stabilize.

To survive the battle, I deliberately sacrifice several Pokémon to stall and burn through the Dynamax turns before committing my remaining attackers. Even with that approach, the fight stays tight until the very end.

After winning, Misty gives me the Cascade Badge and TM03 Water Pulse. Leaving the gym, it becomes clear that this game does not enforce obedience limits in the same way as the original Fire Red, and that combined with smarter AI, Z-Moves, and Dynamax, progression now comes at a real cost.
