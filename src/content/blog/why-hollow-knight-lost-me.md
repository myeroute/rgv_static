<article>There was a moment while playing Hollow Knight when I started to think, “Maybe this game is finally opening up to me.”This wasn’t my first hour with Hollow Knight. At the beginning, I was mostly confused and cautious, trying to understand what kind of game this really was. I spent that early time simply observing, learning the rhythm, and figuring out whether I even wanted to continue. You can read about that initial experience in my article <a href="https://retrogamingverse.com/one-hour-with-hollow-knight/">One Hour With Hollow Knight</a>. After a slow and confusing beginning, after gradually understanding its systems, after accepting that I needed to slow down and play on its terms, Hollow Knight gave me a new ability: dash.That moment created a very natural sense of hope. The game gave me speed. It gave me more control over movement. It gave me a familiar feeling, the kind I remembered from platformers I used to love. For the first time, I thought Hollow Knight might finally allow me to play at my own pace.

And yet, that was the moment when Hollow Knight began to lose me.

<h2>When dash creates a false sense of comfort</h2>
Dash immediately changed how the game felt. Movement became faster, dodging felt more proactive, and everything became smoother and more responsive. At that point, Hollow Knight no longer felt like a game that constantly forced me to stop and observe.

Before this point, Hollow Knight had already forced me to slow down and play more carefully. That shift in pacing fundamentally changed how I approached the game, and I wrote about that moment separately in <a href="https://retrogamingverse.com/the-moment-hollow-knight-forced-me-to-slow-down/">The Moment Hollow Knight Forced Me to Slow Down</a>.

I started thinking about Mega Man X4. A fast game that still gives the player room to breathe. A game where speed feels like a reward, not a burden. I assumed Hollow Knight was heading in that direction, that the slow beginning was simply a test, and once passed, the game would let me play more freely.

That feeling did not last.
<h2>When the map and bosses begin to wear you down</h2>
After getting dash, Hollow Knight did not suddenly become tense at every moment. The game still allowed me to slow down. I could still stop, observe, and rest at familiar points.

But the map became harder to navigate. Platforming sections required more precision. There were more spikes, more situations where a small mistake meant losing health, even with dash available. Movement no longer felt light.

The real fatigue appeared during boss encounters. Here, dash was no longer a tool for comfort. It became the minimum requirement just to keep up. I was never fully sure whether these fights were mandatory, or whether there were other paths I could take. But while playing, the pressure was clear. The game was asking for more, while the punishment for mistakes remained heavy.

Deaths did not come only from bosses. They came from falling into spikes, from small errors during movement, from moments of lost focus. These deaths accumulated, not explosively, but slowly, until continuing no longer felt appealing.

<h2>I thought it was Mega Man X4, but it felt closer to Mega Man Zero</h2>
At this stage, Hollow Knight did not fully become Mega Man Zero. The game still allowed me to slow down. It still gave me moments of rest.

The issue was something else. Dash created a choice, and I almost always chose to move faster. Once I adapted to that rhythm, the map and boss fights began to feel different.

This is where Hollow Knight felt closer to Mega Man Zero than Mega Man X4. Not because the game removed all breathing room, but because playing fast made mistakes far more costly. Platforming demanded precision. Spikes punished hesitation. Boss fights required constant attention. Dash was no longer a reward, it was a requirement.

Mega Man X4 allows players to use speed to control situations, then recover between encounters. Mega Man Zero demands sustained tension, even when you have all the tools you need. At this point, Hollow Knight placed me in a very similar mental state.

Not because the game forced me to play fast, but because once the option existed, the game demanded more from that choice.
<h2>Stopping was not quitting</h2>
After dying repeatedly, I realized something simple. I was tired. Not because the game was bad. Not because I failed to understand it. But because I no longer wanted to maintain that level of focus.

Hollow Knight demands a kind of mental endurance that I was not ready to give at this stage of my life. I could have continued if I truly loved the game, but I did not love it enough to push through exhaustion.

So I stopped.

There was no anger in that decision. No dramatic disappointment. Just a calm recognition of my own limits. Some games are great, but not suited for every rhythm of life. For me, Hollow Knight was one of them.

<h2>Hollow Knight did not lose me because it was hard</h2>
If you have ever played Hollow Knight and stopped somewhere along the way, you may have felt something similar. Not because you lack patience. Not because you are bad at games. But because continuing began to require more mental energy than you wanted to spend.

Many people say Hollow Knight is a great game, then quietly disappear when they stop playing. Few talk about the moment when fatigue sets in, or about the choice to walk away while the game still has more to offer.

Hollow Knight did not lose me because it was slow or unclear. It lost me when it made me feel like I was about to play more freely, then asked for a higher price in return.

Perhaps I will return someday, when I am ready to give more time and energy to a game like this. But not now.

And that is completely fine.
