I came back to Mega Man mostly because of nostalgia. Not the loud, overwhelming kind, but a quieter feeling. The kind that reminds you of something that once felt very familiar. Something tied to long afternoons, to moments of frustration, turning the console off, then turning it back on again not long after, knowing full well you might fail all over again..

I did consider trying games that tried to carry that spirit forward, like <a href="http://www.mightyno9.com/">Mighty No. 9</a>. But the feeling wasn’t quite there. Not because the game was bad. It just didn’t pull me in the same way. Maybe I wasn’t looking for something that felt exactly like the past anymore. I just wanted to see whether Mega Man, the series I actually played back then, still had something to say to me now.

I replayed Mega Man on PC. When I launched Mega Man X4, the familiarity came back surprisingly fast. I didn’t need much time to adjust. The pacing was clear. The controls made sense. Everything felt like it was waiting for me to remember.

But after playing for a while, something became clear. Not every Mega Man game from my memory was as easy to return to. And not every one of them still fit me the same way.
<h2>Mega Man 2 and a difficulty that never really went away</h2>
When I was younger, I played Mega Man 2 with a controller and dropped it fairly early. What I remember most clearly is that it felt hard. Hard in a way that drained me, not in a way that made me eager to try again.

Replaying it now on PC felt a little more manageable. Having precise button input helped a lot. I wasn’t dying because of clumsy mistakes anymore. But the difficulty itself was still there. Mega Man 2 doesn’t try to overwhelm you. It’s simply strict. Make a mistake, and you pay for it, often immediately.

I also tried emulating the NES version on my phone, just to see if it was playable that way. It wasn’t. I could barely move a few steps without dying. Not because the game was bad, but because Mega Man needs responsive buttons. Touch controls simply don’t offer that. With games like this, being slightly off rhythm is enough to make everything fall apart.

After replaying it, I wrote <a href="https://retrogamingverse.com/mega-man-2-reflection/">a separate reflection on Mega Man 2</a>. Not to prove how hard it is, but to think about whether that difficulty comes from the game itself, or from the way and context I’m playing it in now.

<h2>Mega Man Zero and the feeling of being pushed too fast</h2>
Among all the entries I revisited, Mega Man Zero was the most confusing for me. Not because the controls were difficult. I understood how to move and attack fairly quickly. But the game barely explains anything beyond that.

There are many systems layered on top of each other. They’re all there from the start, and the game assumes you’ll figure them out on your own. If you don’t, you die. And in Zero, death comes fast, sometimes before you even understand what you did wrong.

What wore me down wasn’t just the number of deaths, but the constant pressure. Mega Man 2 is also hard, but it gives you moments to breathe. Zero almost never does. Its pace is relentless, always demanding your full attention.

There were moments when I stopped playing and wondered whether I was doing something wrong, or whether I simply wasn’t moving at the speed the game expected anymore. I wrote about that feeling in <a href="https://retrogamingverse.com/mega-man-zero-reflection/">a separate reflection on Mega Man Zero</a>, mostly to remind myself that feeling overwhelmed isn’t unusual here.
<h2>On the speed of Mega Man Zero</h2>
Even so, I have to admit one thing. Mega Man Zero is still incredibly fast. Not fast in a flashy way, but in a way that constantly keeps you on edge.

Even though I’m slower than I used to be, that sense of speed is still there. And that’s both Zero’s biggest strength and its biggest barrier. It’s easy to see why some players love it deeply, and why others walk away halfway through.

I don’t think you need to force yourself to finish Zero. For me, simply understanding why it exhausts me was already enough.

<h2>Mega Man X4, the easiest place to come back</h2>
If someone asked me where to start when coming back to Mega Man, my answer would almost always be X4.

Mega Man X4 doesn’t overwhelm you. Everything is introduced at a reasonable pace. I never felt like the game was pushing me forward too aggressively, or demanding that I prove how skilled I was.

Here, you can simply play. And the game allows you to play at your own rhythm.

Replaying X4 felt light in a good way. Very different from Zero. It didn’t pressure me to get better immediately. It simply reminded me that Mega Man was once a very approachable series, even while still offering depth. I wrote more about <a href="https://retrogamingverse.com/replaying-mega-man-x4/">replaying X4</a> in a separate article for anyone curious.

While revisiting Mega Man, I also realized that the way I play games now is very different from before. And if you’re thinking about replaying retro games or using emulation but don’t quite know where to start, I wrote about that experience in <a href="https://retrogamingverse.com/how-i-replay-retro-games-today/">a separate piece here</a>.
<h2>You don’t need to play every Mega Man game to be a fan</h2>
This is the most important thing I took away from coming back to Mega Man.

You don’t need to play the entire series. You don’t need to force yourself through Zero if it feels overwhelming. You also don’t need to clear Mega Man 2 if its pacing no longer fits you.

Mega Man is broad enough that everyone can find an entry that works for them. Playing one game, understanding it, and stopping there is completely fine. Unless you’re a dedicated fan of the entire series, choosing selectively doesn’t make you any less of a fan.

Coming back to Mega Man isn’t about proving anything. If you can find one entry that feels comfortable to play again, that’s more than enough.
