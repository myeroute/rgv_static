<p>After writing <a href="https://retrogamingverse.com/one-hour-with-hollow-knight/"><em>One Hour with Hollow Knight</em></a>, I still thought I was in a normal learning phase. I did not fully understand the systems yet. I did not know the map well. But everything still felt acceptable. Hollow Knight was slow and slightly vague, but not enough to make me question how I was playing.</p>
<p>I approached it with the same rhythm I was used to from faster platformers like Mega Man. And during the first few hours, the game did not clearly push back against that approach.</p>
<p>It was only when Hollow Knight began to block my progress in a deliberate way that I realized I could not continue playing with the same rhythm.</p>
<h2>Bringing a Mega Man rhythm into a game that does not want you to rush</h2>
<p>With Mega Man, the rhythm is very clear. The game usually pushes the player forward. Standing still is often dangerous. Hesitation leads to mistakes. If you react fast, you survive. If you are late by a moment, you die. I had internalized that rhythm over many years and carried it directly into Hollow Knight.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight is different. It allows you to stand still. It does not force you to keep jumping. It leaves gaps between actions. At first, this felt comfortable. But the more I played, the more I noticed another feeling creeping in. I started to feel slightly bored, because the game was not pushing me to do anything immediately.</p>

<p>For someone used to fast-paced games, being allowed to stand still without punishment was more distracting than relaxing.</p>
<p>I kept playing on instinct. Slightly rushed. Slightly impatient. I assumed that if I pushed the pace myself, Hollow Knight would follow.</p>
<h2>False Knight and the lack of confirmation</h2>
<p>False Knight was the first moment where Hollow Knight responded to how I was playing. Not because the boss was difficult, but because the game refused to confirm my progress. There was no health bar. The boss collapsed, then stood back up. I had no idea whether I was close to winning or still at the beginning.</p>
<p>At one point, I died after running out of health, and I knew that I would lose my Geo and be sent back to the village. At that time, Geo did not feel truly important yet. The shops I had encountered only sold small, non-essential items. But because I did not understand what Geo was really for, losing it created a vague sense of pressure.</p>
<p>I was afraid of losing something whose value I could not yet measure.</p>
<p>That uncertainty made me fight False Knight in a rushed state. I wanted the fight to end quickly, because I was not sure whether I was doing things correctly. Hollow Knight punished that approach. Not by making the boss stronger, but by killing me, sending me back, and forcing me to face my own shade right outside the boss room.</p>

<p>After several attempts, I realized something. The walk back was not as long as it felt at first. Geo could be recovered. What made everything stressful was not the punishment itself, but my lack of understanding.</p>
<p>Once I accepted that dying did not mean losing everything, I entered the next fight with a different mindset.</p>
<p>I did not play better. But I played slower. I watched the boss’s attack patterns, waited for safer moments, and accepted taking damage when necessary, knowing I could heal. The fight became far more manageable.</p>
<p>That was when I started to understand that Hollow Knight does not reward speed. It rewards playing at its rhythm.</p>
<h2>Healing with Soul and being allowed to stop mid-fight</h2>
<p>One system that pushed me further toward slowing down was how Hollow Knight handles healing. Instead of picking up items or relying on checkpoints, the game allows you to heal by consuming Soul, the same resource you gain by hitting enemies.</p>
<p>The important part is that you can heal during boss fights, as long as you find a small, safe window to stand still and Focus.</p>
<p>This system does not demand perfect play. It allows mistakes. You can take damage and correct it within the same fight. But in exchange, you must accept stopping for a moment.</p>
<p>For someone used to fast-paced combat, standing still to heal in the middle of a fight feels unnatural. But the more I used this system, the clearer it became that Hollow Knight was encouraging me to slow down in a controlled way, rather than constantly rushing forward.</p>
<h2>When the map does not help you move faster</h2>
<p>The pressure to slow down does not come only from combat. It also comes from how Hollow Knight handles its map. The map is not given by default. The compass is not automatic. If I wanted to know where I was, I had to buy it and give up a charm slot.</p>
<p>This may sound minor, but it directly affects movement. Without reliable positioning, I could not rush through areas just to get them over with. I had to observe the environment, remember landmarks, and move more carefully.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight does not forbid moving fast. It simply does not grant that ability for free.</p>

<h2>Vengeful Spirit, Snail Shaman, and the gate called Greenpath</h2>
<p>The moment Hollow Knight truly forced me to slow down came from the quest involving Snail Shaman and the Vengeful Spirit ability. After receiving the task, nothing was marked on the map. There were no arrows. No hints. I wandered through familiar areas, convinced I had missed something.</p>
<p>At one point, I was genuinely stuck. And only when I slowed down and paid closer attention did I find a way forward.</p>
<p>While moving more carefully, I noticed a wooden floor beneath my feet that could be broken, dropping me into a boss room. This was not a hidden secret. It was simply easy to miss if you always move forward without looking down.</p>

<p>Only after falling into that room did I realize that this quest was mandatory. The boss was the same creature I had encountered earlier at the entrance to <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Greenpath">Greenpath</a>.</p>
<p>When I first met it, it felt strange. Whenever I approached, it curled up and fully defended itself, making all melee attacks useless. Only when I stepped back did it stand up and expose its body. But at that time, I had no way to attack from a distance. Not understanding the mechanic, I turned around and left.</p>
<p>This boss fight acted as a delayed tutorial. During the fight, Hollow Knight clearly instructed me to use Focus to unleash Vengeful Spirit. Without the new ability, progression was impossible.</p>
<p>When I returned to Greenpath afterward, the mechanic finally made sense. Standing at a distance caused the creature to expose itself, and for the first time, I had a ranged attack to deal with it.</p>
<p>Vengeful Spirit was no longer a skill to experiment with. It was a requirement.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight had blocked this path from the very beginning, but it only explained why after I had slowed down enough to connect the pieces.</p>

<p>What stood out was that I did not feel a strong emotional reaction at that moment. From the start, Hollow Knight had offered very little guidance. Learning how it works felt inevitable. But that inevitability forced me to accept something important. If I kept rushing through the game, I would continue to be blocked like this.</p>
<h2>Slow does not always feel comfortable</h2>
<p>At this point, I still cannot say that I like Hollow Knight. Its slower pace sometimes feels dull to me. There are moments where I stand still, observe the environment, and feel as if the game is leaving empty space for me to fill.</p>
<p>For someone used to faster games, the lack of constant pressure can reduce focus instead of increasing immersion.</p>
<p>But I also recognize that this discomfort does not come from poor design. It comes from Hollow Knight refusing to reward the habits I brought in from other games. I am trying to play Hollow Knight with a Mega Man rhythm, and Hollow Knight refuses to adapt.</p>
<h2>When Hollow Knight begins to respond to the player</h2>
<p>This is the point where Hollow Knight truly begins to respond to me. Not by raising the difficulty, but by closing off progression until I adjust how I play.</p>
<p>The game never tells you to slow down. It simply creates situations where playing too fast consistently leads to friction.</p>
<p>At the end of this experience, I am still not sure whether I want to commit to Hollow Knight long-term. Its rhythm does not naturally align with mine, and I do not feel pulled forward by instinct.</p>
<p>But at the very least, I now understand why Hollow Knight causes so many players to stop midway. It does not push you forward. It makes you stop, observe, and accept that sometimes, moving forward requires slowing down first.</p>
