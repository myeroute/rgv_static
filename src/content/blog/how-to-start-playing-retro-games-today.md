<a href="https://retrogamingverse.com/what-are-retro-games/">Retro games</a> have a quiet way of making things feel simpler. They rarely ask you to learn dozens of systems or master long tutorials. Most of the time you can open a game, play for a few minutes, then close it and go on with your day. That ease is part of their charm.

I remember when I was a kid, back then I only had a crappy laptop I borrowed from my uncle. It ran slow and the fan was loud, but it was enough to play Fire Emblem GBA, Mega Man and Pokemon GBA for hours. I did not know much about emulation then. I just launched VisualBoyAdvance, remapped a few buttons, and started playing. Years later I switched to phone emulators like John GBA Lite for quick sessions, and the feeling stayed the same: small, familiar worlds you can drop into anytime.

If you want to try playing retro games, emulator-first is the most approachable route. This guide focuses on emulators, basic setup and picking a first game. It is deliberately light on technical detail so you can get going without feeling overwhelmed.
<h2>Why emulators are the easiest way to start playing retro games</h2>
You can play retro games on original consoles, modern retro handhelds, or dedicated devices, but those options often come with costs and extra steps. Emulators let you play on hardware you already own, a PC, a laptop, or a phone, with minimal fuss. Most emulators offer a simple workflow: open the program, load a game file, configure buttons, and play.

I once tried ePSXe for Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories and it took me half a day to set up the BIOS correctly. That experience was frustrating at the time, but it also taught me how emulators expect certain files and settings. After you learn the basics, many emulators feel straightforward and flexible.

<h2>PC or phone - both work</h2>
One of the nicest things about emulation is device choice. PC gives you a larger screen and more comfortable controls. Phone emulators are convenient for quick plays on the go. I often open John GBA Lite on the phone when I wait for a bus or wait for an elevator. It is simple and satisfying.

For a smooth start, you only need to focus on three basic things: choosing the right emulator, mapping buttons, and using save states. Those three will cover almost every scenario you meet as a beginner.
<h2>Which emulator to try first</h2>
Newcomers can feel lost with all the emulator names out there. You do not need to try them all. Pick one that matches the system you want to play and that has a reputation for being user friendly.

For many beginners, GBA emulators like VisualBoyAdvance or mGBA are the gentlest introduction. They have a simple interface and run most GBA games without fuss. <a href="https://www.snes9x.com/">SNES9X</a> is similarly straightforward for SNES titles. PS1 emulators such as ePSXe or DuckStation are also good, but they may require an extra setup step such as placing a BIOS file before games run. If you are curious about Nintendo DS, DeSmuME or MelonDS are capable emulators that let you play NDS titles like Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver.
<p class="note">Tip: Choose an emulator that "looks understandable" the first time you open it. Feeling comfortable on first run helps a lot.</p>

<h2>How to pick your first retro game</h2>
Not every retro title is a good first pick. Some classics were designed to be challenging, and that can be discouraging for a new player. Pick something that matches what you already enjoy. For me, Fire Emblem and Pokemon were perfect because they pace slowly and let you save often. Mega Man is fun but can be demanding in terms of timing and reflexes.

If you are undecided, watch a few short clips on YouTube to see if the game's look and pace appeal to you. A one- or two-minute gameplay video can quickly tell you whether a title fits your taste.
<h2>Simple emulator setup you will use a lot</h2>
You do not need to learn every feature of an emulator at once. Start with the basics:

First, load your game file into the emulator. Then open the input or controller settings and map buttons so they feel natural. Use save states for quick progress saves. If a game's speed seems off, check the speed or frame skip setting and return it to normal. These few steps will let you play comfortably in most situations.

I remember when I first installed ePSXe for Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories: I kept remapping buttons and accidentally set the game speed too high. It took a couple of tries to get it right. Those little stumbles are normal and they become trivial after a few plays.

<h2>Retro-style indie - modern games with a retro heart</h2>
If raw retro feels too dated, <a href="https://retrogamingverse.com/retro-style-indie-games-explained/">retro-style indie games</a> are a great alternative. Titles like Shovel Knight, The Messenger, Celeste or Blasphemous capture the look and spirit of 8-bit or 16-bit games while offering modern controls and design. They can feel more welcoming to players used to contemporary game standards.

Note that retro-style indie games are usually commercial products. Buying them via official stores supports the developers and helps more such games get made. I cannot speak to cracked versions, and I recommend the legitimate route if you want to support creators.
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
Getting into playing retro games does not require deep technical knowledge or expensive hardware. With one emulator, one game, and a handful of basic settings, you can start exploring retro worlds right away. I started with a borrowed laptop and VisualBoyAdvance, and those small, repeated sessions kept me coming back for years.

If you enjoy the first few games, you will naturally want to learn more. When that time comes, I will publish detailed guides on specific emulators, configuration tips, and optimization for each system. For now, pick an emulator, find a game you like, and give it a try.
