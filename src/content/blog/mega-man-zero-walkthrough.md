<h2>Introduction to This Mega Man Zero Walkthrough</h2>
This is not a complete or optimized Mega Man Zero walkthrough. It is a record of my first-time experience with the game, written while I was actually playing and getting stuck along the way. Instead of listing every step or explaining every mechanic, this walkthrough focuses only on moments that confused me, slowed me down, or made me stop and figure things out.

I intentionally leave out parts of the game that feel straightforward or easy to understand. Those moments are better experienced firsthand. The sections below exist only because I personally struggled there, misunderstood something, or thought the game was unclear. If you are a new player and find yourself stuck in the same places, this walkthrough is meant to help you move forward without taking away the sense of discovery.

This walkthrough does not explain every system or mechanic in the game. Some things remained unclear to me even after many hours, and I intentionally leave them that way. If you are looking for a complete or optimized guide, this may not be what you need.
<h2>Opening Stage and the First Boss</h2>
The game starts with the scene where Ciel finds Zero, and Passy sacrifices himself to awaken him. There is nothing complicated here. You just move backward, shoot the white box to collect a Cyber-elf, then keep moving upward while escorting Ciel. At this point, Zero does not have his sword yet. You only have the Buster, so everything feels a bit stiff and limited.

While playing this opening section, I recommend trying to collect at least 250 Energy Crystals by defeating enemies. This may become important for the Disposal Center mission. I am not entirely sure why this requirement did not appear again in later runs, but during my first playthrough, this caused me to get completely stuck. If you want an easy source of crystals, prioritize the spider nests. They respawn enemies quickly and drop crystals quite often.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/Pay%20attention%20to%20the%20number%20of%20crystal.webp" alt="" width="637" height="328" />

Follow the story and you will encounter the first boss. Try to aim for its head. Once its HP drops to about half, Zero receives his sword. With the sword, the fight becomes much easier. That said, you can still defeat the boss using only the Buster. I actually did that because I did not understand how to use the sword properly at first.

After defeating the boss, Ciel walks toward a door. You need to stand in front of the door and press <strong>Up</strong> to follow her. I spent nearly 10 minutes running around before realizing this. Once inside, jump onto the machine and select <strong>“Return to Base.”</strong>

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/Use%20up%20button%20when%20standing%20at%20this%20door%20to%20proceed.webp" alt="" width="637" height="329" />

Back at the base, after receiving the Disposal Center mission, I could not proceed any further on my first playthrough. After receiving the mission, nothing happened. At the time, I thought running through the back door of Ciel would start the mission, but no, it showed that it was locked. Then the game felt stuck, and I spent around 30 minutes wandering around. If you're experiencing a similar situation, you can try my method. The solution I found in my case was to return to the Underground Laboratory, collect 250 Energy Crystals, and give them to the starving Reploid at the bottom area of the base. Once you give him the crystals, he moves away and allows you to move forward to get a Cyber Elf (slash the white box to get).

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/Go%20to%20the%20bottom%20and%20meet%20one%20reploid%20who%20asks%20for%20250%20crystal.webp" alt="" width="637" height="328" />

<img class="size-medium" src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/Get%20another%20cyber-elf.webp" width="637" height="320" />
<h2>Disposal Center Mission – Aztec Falcon</h2>
After getting that Cyber-elf, you can come back and talk with Ciel and finally start the Disposal Center mission. In this stage, the main threat comes from the rolling spiked balls. Other than that, keep moving forward until you reach the boss, Aztec Falcon. This boss is fairly manageable. Focus on dodging its blue energy attacks and keep attacking.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/Aztec%20Falcon%20boss.webp" alt="" width="637" height="320" />

After defeating Aztec Falcon, you receive the Thunder Chip. With this chip, charged attacks gain the electric element. You can activate this in the character menu under Element. Press <strong>Enter</strong> to open the menu.
<h2>Destroy the Train Mission – Pantheon Core</h2>
After returning to the base, I chose the Destroy the Train mission. This stage includes a sub-boss, and the approach is simple. Attack aggressively and focus on dodging. After boarding the train, you face Pantheon Core. Its fire attacks are easy to avoid, but the move where it pushes rocks from the floor and forces you into spikes at the ceiling is extremely punishing.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/Boss%20of%20the%20Destroy%20the%20Train%20mission.webp" alt="" width="637" height="319" />

One mistake here usually means death. I had to replay this mission nearly ten times before clearing it.
<h2>Retrieve Data Mission – Maha Ganeshariff</h2>
After that, I accepted the Retrieve Data mission, which also takes place in the Underground Laboratory. There is not much navigation in this stage, and you move straight toward the boss. Maha Ganeshariff is weak to Electricity, which is the main reason I chose this mission at that point.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/boss%20of%20the%20Retrieve%20Data%20mission.webp" alt="" width="637" height="320" />

When the boss transforms into a sphere and grapples his trunk to ceiling, slash the trunk chain to stop that attack. When it rolls into a ball, jumping over it is usually enough.

After defeating the boss, Ciel warns that the base is about to collapse. Run to the right side and break the door to escape. Afterward, talk to Ciel again and she will guide you to Cerveau to receive a new weapon, <a href="https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki/Triple_Rod">the Triple Rod</a>.
<h2>Find the Shuttle Mission – Anubis</h2>
After obtaining the Triple Rod, I chose the Find the Shuttle mission. This mission is genuinely difficult, especially because of Anubis. He is weak to Fire, but at this point, I only had Electric attacks, so I relied on normal slash attacks.

During this stage, you only need to pay attention to destroying the machines that create sinking sand traps and dealing with the nanobots Anubis summons. If they latch onto you, they drain a large amount of HP very quickly. After defeating Anubis, continue forward and escort the injured Reploid back to the base.

<em>(Walkthrough continues as I keep playing.)</em>
<h2>Occupy Factory Mission</h2>
After finishing the previous missions, I chose Occupy Factory, mainly because it appeared at the top of the mission list.

In this stage, I encountered a warning about not getting detected by the sensors. There is a section where you are forced to pass through a sensor, but if you have already cleared the earlier ones and move fast enough, you can still reach the elevator in time. When you see the switch, slash it to go down.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Slash%20the%20button%20to%20control%20elevator.webp" alt="" width="637" height="319" />

Continue moving forward and upward and you will eventually reach the boss room. The section where you have to stand on the moving robots carrying logs caused me to die many times. One small mistake and you fall straight into the pit, which felt quite frustrating.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Standing%20on%20the%20bots%20on%20the%20way%20to%20the%20boss.webp" alt="" width="637" height="320" />

The boss of this stage only takes damage when it extends its arms. Each arm color corresponds to a different element. Focus your attacks on the central core to deal damage.

<img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/The%20boss%20of%20the%20Occupy%20Factory%20mission.webp" width="637" height="320" />

After defeating the boss, you receive the Flame Chip.

<img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Get%20the%20flame%20chip%20after%20defeating%20the%20boss%20of%20occupy%20factory.webp" width="637" height="328" />
<h2>Giant Mechaniloid Mission</h2>
After returning to the base, Ciel assigns a special mission to fight the Giant Mechaniloid. The game tells you to find its weak point. The weak point is not hard to figure out, so I recommend discovering it on your own.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Fight%20to%20the%20Giant%20Mechaniloid.webp" alt="" width="637" height="319" />

Once the mechaniloid is defeated, return to the base to receive the next mission.
<h2>Rescue Colbor Mission</h2>
I chose Rescue Colbor, mainly because it was also near the top of the mission list.

When entering this stage, make sure to carefully check if there are any paths you can enter. Some routes are easy to miss if you rush forward.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Always%20carefully%20check%20at%20the%20start%20of%20every%20mission%20to%20get%20more%20items.webp" alt="" width="637" height="329" />

Continue progressing until you encounter Harpuia, one of X’s Four Guardians. This fight was quite difficult. However, once you become familiar with his moveset, it is still possible to defeat him without anything special.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Harpuia%20-%20one%20of%20four%20guardians%20of%20X.webp" alt="" width="637" height="328" />
<h2>Find Hidden Base Mission</h2>
Next, I selected Find Hidden Base. This mission takes place in the desert area where I previously fought Anubis, but a new path is now available.

At one point, I felt completely stuck. Below me were only spikes, and I could not see any safe way forward.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Felt%20stuck%20at%20this%20stage.webp" alt="" width="637" height="320" />

Eventually, I realized that I needed to slash the rock in front of me so it would fall down. You can then jump onto it to continue. After that, you will reach an icy path. There is a ladder going up, but before climbing it, keep moving forward on the icy route to collect additional items.

Climbing the ladder leads to the hidden base. Here, you need to rescue seven Reploids that are being held captive. If you accidentally trigger enemies and raise an alarm, do not panic. Hide for a short time and the alert will eventually stop.

<img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Slash%20the%20stone%20at%20the%20front%20to%20drop%20and%20jump%20on%20it.webp" width="637" height="328" />

After rescuing all the Reploids and reaching a locked door, Ciel will inform you that the password has been changed and she needs time to crack it. At this point, you may feel confused, just like I did.

<img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Ciel%20notifies%20that%20the%20password%20of%20the%20door%20has%20been%20changed.webp" width="637" height="328" />

The solution is to make sure you have rescued all the captive Reploids. Then, move upward and go to the left side. At the end of that path, you will find the rescued Reploids. They will thank you and ask you to defeat the boss so they can escape. After that, enter the door to fight the boss.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Ensure%20that%20you%20saved%20all%20reploids.webp" alt="" width="637" height="328" />

This boss uses Ice-based attacks, so using Fire attacks makes the fight much easier. After defeating it, you receive the Ice Chip, which allows your attacks to gain the ice element.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Boss%20of%20the%20Find%20Hidden%20Base%20mission.webp" alt="" width="637" height="329" />
<h2>Duel in the Desert Mission</h2>
After that, I chose Duel in the Desert. This mission is not particularly difficult, except that you must once again fight one of X’s Guardians, Fefnir.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Fefnire%20-%20one%20of%20four%20guardians%20of%20X.webp" alt="" width="637" height="320" />
<h2>Protect Factory Mission</h2>
The next mission I selected was Protect Factory. Right at the start, I had to face another Guardian of X, Phantom.

After being defeated, Phantom reveals that he has planted bombs throughout the factory, turning the mission into a race against time. This part genuinely made me feel tense and pressured.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/After%20being%20defeated%2C%20Phantom%20said%20he%20planted%20many%20bombs%20in%20factory%20and%20Zero%20needs%20to%20evacuate%20the%20place.webp" alt="" width="637" height="320" />

Most of the bombs are fairly easy to locate, but I personally got stuck on the final one. I could not find it at first, but looking carefully at the environment eventually revealed its location.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/The%20bomb%20you%20may%20not%20see.webp" alt="" width="637" height="320" />

Once all the bombs are destroyed, the mission ends.
<h2>Stop the Hacking Mission</h2>
The final mission on Ciel’s current list is Stop the Hacking, which takes place in the desert and leads back to the hidden base area from earlier. This time, a previously inaccessible door can now be opened.

In this mission, you are suddenly able to dive underwater, which caught me off guard. Focus on finding a way onto the boat, and you will eventually locate a ladder leading upward.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Find%20the%20ladder%20from%20boats.webp" alt="" width="637" height="320" />

Proceed to the room shown at the end of the path and destroy the machines inside to complete the objective.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Destroy%20machines%20in%20this%20room.webp" alt="" width="637" height="320" />

After destroying them, I once again felt stuck, unsure of what to do next. Much later, I realized that Ciel had instructed me to return to the base. Because I tend to skip dialogue quickly, I had missed this detail. If you ever feel stuck, try reviewing what Ciel told you in the dialogue.

After returning, I faced the final Guardian of X, Leviathan.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Leviathan%20-%20one%20of%20four%20guardians%20of%20X.webp" alt="Leviathan boss fight in Stop the Hacking mission" width="637" height="320" />

Leviathan is weak to Fire, and her moveset is relatively simple, so I did not have much trouble defeating her.
<h2>Toward Neo Arcadia</h2>
After completing this mission, returning to the base triggers an alert that the base is under attack. At this point, you learn more about the story through Ciel’s confession.

Follow the game’s instructions and you will reach the Energy Room, where you fight Hanumachine, a subordinate of Phantom.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/boss%20Hanumachine%20of%20Mega%20Man%20Zero.webp" alt="" width="637" height="328" />

Defeating Hanumachine unlocks the mission to Neo Arcadia Shrine. In this stage, proceed normally until you encounter the boss. There is a sub-boss involving two identical robots, but there is nothing particularly noteworthy about that fight.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/First%20boss%20Zero%20met%20in%20Neo%20Arcadia%20Shrine.webp" alt="" width="637" height="320" />

The main boss of this stage is weak to Electricity and can be defeated quickly with the right attacks.

Continue forward and you will face another boss encounter. There is a difficult section involving platforms where rocks appear and disappear in a repeating pattern. It may take a few tries, but it is manageable.

The next boss is Herculious Anchortus, who is weak to Ice. Using Ice-based attacks gives you a clear advantage in this fight.

<img src="https://images.retrogamingverse.com/r1/1225/19/22/Second%20boss%20Zero%20met%20in%20Neo%20Arcadia%20Shrine.webp" alt="" width="637" height="319" />

After defeating him, return to the base and receive the mission to head into Neo Arcadia.

From this point on, the game becomes heavily focused on consecutive boss fights. Because of this, and because I was already feeling quite exhausted from the constant difficulty, I decided not to continue the walkthrough beyond this point. I will update it if I return to the game and play further.

This walkthrough focuses only on moments where I got stuck or felt confused during my first playthrough. If you’re curious how my feelings changed after spending more time with the game, I wrote <a href="https://retrogamingverse.com/mega-man-zero-reflection/">a separate reflection</a> after about twelve hours of play.
